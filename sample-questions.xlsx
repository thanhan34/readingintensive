Climate Change Impact	Global warming is causing significant changes to Earth's climate patterns. Rising temperatures lead to melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events. Scientists warn that immediate action is necessary to prevent irreversible damage to our planet's ecosystems.	RWFIB
Ocean Acidification	The world's oceans absorb about one-third of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. When CO2 dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, making the ocean more acidic. This process threatens marine life, particularly organisms that build shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate.	RFIB
Renewable Energy Future	Solar and wind power are becoming increasingly important sources of clean energy. These renewable technologies offer sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Many countries are investing heavily in expanding their renewable energy infrastructure.	RWFIB
